👋 Hello! I'm **Josiah**, and I work as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Nintex. I enjoy solving complex problems using DevOps tools and frameworks, while at the same time looking for opportunities on how to improve processes and optimize tooling.

☁️ Cloud Platforms (AWS)\
🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation)\
⚓ Containers & Orchestration (Kubernetes, AWS EKS, AWS ECS, Docker, Rancher)\
♾️ CI / CD (Argo CD, CircleCI, Drone, TeamCity, Spinnaker)\
📔 Web Servers (Linux, Microsoft IIS, AWS EC2)\
🌐 DNS & Reverse Proxies (CloudFlare, Nginx, Route 53)\
🛢️ Databases (DynamoDB, MySQL. PostgreSQL)\
