👋 Hello! I'm **Josiah**, and I work as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at Nintex. I enjoy solving complex problems using DevOps tools and frameworks, while at the same time looking for opportunities on how to improve processes and optimize tooling. The work I do helps to ensure the performance and reliability of websites and services, both to external users and internal employees.

Below is a list of relevant tools and frameworks I have experience with:

☁️ Cloud Platforms (AWS)\
🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS CloudFormation)\
♾️ CI / CD (CircleCI, Drone, TeamCity, Spinnaker, Argo CD)\
📜 Scripting (Bash, Node.js, Powershell)\
⚓ Containers & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, AWS EKS, AWS ECS)\
🔭 Monitoring & Observability (Datadog, CloudWatch, OpsGenie, Sentry, PagerDuty)\
🪣 Source Code Management (GitHub, BitBucket)\
🛢️ Databases (DynamoDB, SQL)\
🌐 Reverse Proxies & Web Servers (CloudFlare, Nginx, IIS, AWS EC2)
